## Bugs

  * When I deployed my project to GitHub , I discovered that the Favicon was not displaying on the Contact Page.
  The reason behind this issue was that the path to favicon was not added correctly.
  Fixed this by adding the correct path.

## Unfixed bugs
 * Dark mode visibility - The landing page isn't showing the Animated Text due to dark mode.

## Deployment

* The site was deployed to GitHub pages. Since I started building my website on VSCode a desktop version and got bigger part of it, I first uploaded the already coded files to IDE and after added few changes, deployed it to GitHub. The steps to deploy are as follows:
   + In the GitHub repository, navigated to the Settings tab
   + From the source section drop-down menu, selected the Master Branch
   + Once the master branch has been selected, the page was automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
   + It took some 5 minutes for the project to be deployed.
